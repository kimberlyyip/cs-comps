explain why we are doing this in the elevator pitch
explain what your comps is
what the vulnerabilties involved are, what these vulnerabilities are

30s to a min elevator pitch
- ask if they have been to the other posters and go from there
- high level overview before questions
- try a bunch of different versions 
-- different pitches for different backgrounds
-- think about what a prof might want to know

Everybody: be able to simply say what the attacker has after each step of the attack (e.g. normal username and password, web shell as user, password hash of root, etc.)

+ Walkthroughs
- walkthough should be deeper than the poster 
- how does the vulnerability work
- on the one hand its "what is this particular attacker going to do" on the other hand it "this is the line of code that causes this"
- focus: learn more about the topic not just how to break into machines
- include diagrams as well and screenshots
- no longer than 20 pages (8-12 pages)
- mitigation methods (great but not necessary) 
- also explain why we made certain choices to implement our vulnerabilties (explain why unifi)

practicioner tone rather than academic paper tone
