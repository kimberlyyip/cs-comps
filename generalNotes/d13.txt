Final deliverable:
- poster + (written or video) walkthrough
  - video would need to have a good amount of depth that is equivallent to the written walkthough
- what jeff wants
  - an interesting chain of vulns implemented in VM 
  - a walkthough that includes
    - step-by-step story of how a hacker goes from just knowing the IP address to having a root shell
    - detauled, clear deeper dives into the mechanisms behind 1-3 of your vulns (supper complex? 1 deep dive is enough; interessting but simple? do 2+ deeper dives)
  - a plausible story about how this VM might have gotten to be this way
  - from here on out: it's yours to craft the way you want it 

Feedback from draft1:
- clarify how all the bugs chain together
- write it from the attackers pov and give clairty about where you are starting
