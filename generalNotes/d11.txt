Rough deadline guidlines found on class notes

Authentication
- Web "basic authentication"
-- cs338.jeffondich.com/basicauth
-- protocol
-- implementation server-side
-- .htpasswd file
- Login passwords
-- /etc/passwd
--- no actual passwords just tells you the accounts
-- /etc/shadow
--- between the first colon and the second colon is all one form input
--- the sections of the form are separated by $
--- the salt is between the third and fourth $
--- the salt is used to hash 
--- www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file
--- checks passwd file first for hash and checks to see if what the user typed in matches 
--- if there is no hash in the passwd file to check against, then it checks the shadow file
--- a possible vulnerability: write into the password file a password for root; use that password to 'login' to root, then you can run as root
--- dependent on which file is checked first password or root
--- protection against insider threats by storing the hash instead of the password itself
-- cryptographic hash functions (shasum command)
--- echo -n password | shasum -a 256 
---- -n tag indicates to not include newline 
---- shasum is to encode it with sha-256
-- what does ssh do?
- Password cracking: (popular tools: john the ripper, hashcat)
-- passphrase on private key
-- passphrase on zip file
-- passphrase on password manager vault 
-- xxx2john commands
- Session keys 
-- how cookies work 
-- what is a session ke
- so much more
-- (Windows) NTLM, kerberos
-- OAuth (authorization, not authentication, but people use it for authentication anywyay)
