How to go deeper in comps final proj?
- set up your vm but how can you make it more verbose?
- the vm may be set up with basic linux knowledge but...
- ...dig deeper in the reasonings behind that
-- ex. why does this process use MD5 over SHA-256?
-- What is the history and development behind MD5?
-- what does sudo do?
-- what does setuid do?
- Look at the literature, source code, famous bugs 
- ex. of famous bugs:
-- Heartbleed (OpenSSL)
-- Shellshock (bash)
- Pick a spot in you project to go deeper
