dhcp: dynamic host configuration protocol 
- will attempt to connect to a dh-- server

attempt to fix the fail of boot of new vms
- change the etc/net/00-yaml file to include both ens33 and enops1, and set both to true

du -sh ~/Virtual\ Machines.localized/*
- gives you all the machines and the size

What techniques were useful?
- gobuster
- try to think like the people ("WWRD")
- searchsploit 
-- searchsploit -m textfile code
-- then can look at the file given and read it
- search online for reverse shells (revshells.com)

"lateral movement" and "privilege escalation"
- lateral movement: move from one machine to another
- privilege escalation: can i move from one user to a more privliged user; goal is to be root
- steps
-- TargetA
--- php-based web server
--- directory traversal + weblog poisoning
--- get reverse shell
--- look around, find Database.kdbk
-- Offline
--- crack Database.kdbx master password
--- dig through database and find private key for sarah
-- TargetB
--- ssh -i key.sarah sarah@IP_target_B
--- poke around
--- find: /etc/cron.d/backup -- running once per minute
---       /var/backup/create_backup.sh -- sarah can't read it
--- /opt/backupborg/* -- borg is a backup utility
--- sudo -l -- sarah can run "borg list", "borg extract", and "borg mount" as root with sudo and not password
--- try "borg list /opt/backupborg" -- nope, you need a passphrase
--- pspy64 to show me new processes as they launch; one of the processes had the passphrase in the command line
--- run borg list, borg extract... get some files
--- the files have secrets 
--- i have to crack another password 
--- now i'm root
--- htop

poison the /var/log file
access the /var/log file through directory traversal
run php code that you used to poison the log
