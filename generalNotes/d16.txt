+ What makes a good poster?
- Style matters: make it pop visually
- Type needs to be big (30pt or bigger)
- Title should draw you in
- Don't make it too much info (keep word count low)
- Think about audience
- Use graphics
- Be careful w/ colors
	- color blindness
	- too dark is trouble
	- contrast matters
- clear sections and/or natural flow
- Do multiple drafts; get feedback
