essential unix commands and concepts?
- cat, ls -alh, file, cd, man, exit, |, >, <, 2>/dev/null
- nmap, ssh, openssl, ping
- reading the manual
- permissions (chmod, chown, ls -l)
- setuid: allows you to run the process as the owner of that program

echo hello | wc -c    is equivallent to     wc -c <<< hello
- in this case <<< sends standard output through

ways to make Unix (intentionally or not) insecure?
- badly set permissions
- openly available passwords
- crackable/guessable passwords
- No limit to number of password guesses
- Not changing defaults (kali/kali, for example)
- using obscurity (ex. weird locations to store info)
- git-related stuff
 - secrets in old commits 
 - secrets in tags and log messages
- cron-related stuff?
 - ex. cron job that exploits bad permissions

Web Servers and Clients Lab notes:
- the v shows all the GET information
- What name does the python3 web server use for itself?
Different interfaces:
- lo: stands for local machine/host
- eth0: stands for ethernet. in this case it refers to a virtual machine thing
- link/ether...: is the mac address
- inet...: is the ip address
