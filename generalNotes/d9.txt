Step by step how to start breaking in to a vm:
- Find the ip address:
-- ifconfig | grep inet
-- nmap -sn 172.16.41.0/24
(/24 indicates keep the leftmost 24 bits fixed and try all possible combinations after)
-- VMware and UTM will also just tell you the ip address
- "Enumeration" port scanning
-- mkdir temporarydir
-- nmap -sV -oN OUTPUTFILE -Pn IPADDRESS
(if you find a server listening on a port, try to find out what version that is)
(the default nmap -sV tries the top most common ports) 
(the "-Pn" is only if you are sure that the computer is there at the IP address)
-- in kali would also do: searchsploit apache 2.4
-- curl --path-as-is http://IPADDRESS/../../../etc/passwd
-- directory traversal attempting to go back three to var/www/html
- gobutster directory 
(trying to find files that are linked to the server but can't log in to them)
(gobuster will try curl with a bunch of different stuff after the ipaddress)
with an up to date apache, the ../../.. technique might not work

A few initial steps when attacking a target
- I'm assuming you know the IP or you need to do host detection
- Web server? 
  - Poke around, with and without Burp Suite
    - File upload?
    - Directory traversal? local/remote file inclusion?
    - SQL injection?
  - directory enumeration (gobuster)
  - subdomain enumeration (gobuster)
- Password spraying 

An option to limit nmap is to block pings
