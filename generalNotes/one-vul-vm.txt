One way to open a port is to start a server
most likely called a ftp server
systemctl not just to start the server but also to enable the server
sudo systemctl enable ftp
sudo systemctl start ftp

enable says start at boot time 
start says to start now 

need to edit config files to see it point to the right things

What is the defaulst config in ftp, can i put a default file in that space

ftp has standard anonymous, allowing you to log in anonymously and access files in this anonymous space 

How to actually open the port

nft command

all ports are open, but it may not have a server listening on them 

firewall may reject certain ports
