short reports on some web security vulnerabitlity classes w/ a demo
1. 
2. creating a vm example for demo
3. presentation
use php why? common for types of attacks (mainly cause wordpress is written in it)

when downloading Burp Proxy (on Kali?)
- sudo apt update
-- apt is similar to homebrew
- sudo apt upgrade
- sudo atp install burpsuite

proxy tool in Burp Suite
- proxy > intercept > open browser > intercept is on

make sure its not in https but rather http then you can click 'forward'

can use curl to control what you want to send to the server/see

php like pearl starts variables with $
- $_ is known as a super global variable
- dictionaries in php are called arrays

<?php
    $user = $_REQUEST['user'];

    echo  "Hello there, $user";
?>

if you want to combine GET and POST use REQUEST
the browser does not get to see the php code
