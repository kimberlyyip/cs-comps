bandit0
How to ssh: ssh username@host -p portnumber  
password: bandit0

bandit0 -> bandit1
password found in the readme
password: NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL

bandit1 -> bandit2
How to open files with '-' in the name: need to specify location (ex: cat ./-)
password: rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

bandit2 -> bandit3
How to open files with spaces in the file name: need to wrap file name in quotes or put a backslash before each space
(ex: "file with spaces" or file\ with\ spaces)
password: aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG

bandit3 -> bandit4
hidden files (. files) can be listed and found with "ls -a" or "ls -all"
password: 2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe

bandit4 -> bandit5
opened each file to find which was human readable: found in file07
password: lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR

bandit5 -> bandit6
use find to find file size: find -size 1033c
password: P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU

bandit6 -> bandit7
the file is found somewhere on the server so you need to backout to the base directory to find the file
you can stack finds: find -size 33c -group bandit7 -user bandit6
Comment from Jeff: 
   "Sydney DM'd me her attempted find command, which was great. But what I'm sure she experienced and many of you may 
      have as well is sometimes you get overwhelmed by "permission denied" and other error messages. So instead of 
      doing find [dir] [flags] whatever, you can pipe the standard error (stderr) output away from your terminal like this:
         find / blah blah blah 2>/dev/null
      That is, you pipe file #2 (i.e., stderr) to the pseudo-file /dev/null, which has the effect of just discarding all 
   the stderr output."
password: /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

bandit7 -> bandit8
you can use grep to find words and which file line it is located on: grep -n "word" filename
password: TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP

bandit8 -> bandit9
you need to sort the file before you can find the line that only occurs once
uniq -u only works on adjacent lines
sort places all the lines adjacent to one another
sort filename | uniq -u
password: EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t

bandit9 -> bandit10
To output all the human readable strings use: strings filename
password: G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s

bandit10 -> bandit11
to decode a file encoded in base64: base64 -d filename
password: 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM

bandit11 -> bandit12
You can use tr to translate a given string: cat filename | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
password: JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv

bandit12 -> bandit13
reverse a hexdump: xxd -r inputfile > outputfile
use file to check file type 
change the name of the file to be a valid file type and then decompress
initially a gzip compress file: gzip -d file.txt.gz
then a bzip compress file: bzip2 -d file.txt.bz
then a gzip compress file
then tar: tar -xf file.txt.tar
then tar
then bzip
then tar
then gzip 
password: wbWdlBxEir4CaE8LaPhauuOo6pwRmrDw 

bandit13 -> bandit14
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220

bandit14 -> bandit15
password: fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
nc localhost 30000
password: jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt
paste the password from the previous level to get the password to the next level
what does nc mean?
- nc stands for net cat (concatenate)
- means to send network traffic back and forth
nc host port
1. make a TCP connection for the remote server
2. wait for stdin/keyboard input, send it along to the server
3. print anything the server sends back 
nc makes a connection the server allowing you to send the password from the previous level, when it receives an input,
it sends a response or kills the connection
this is not much different from ssh

bandit15 -> bandit16
protocol used for this level is tls which is an encrypted protocol
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
submit the previous password to output the next password
password: JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1

bandit16 -> bandit17
need to scan the range and find which ports are open and available: nmap -p31000-32000 localhost
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
given a rsa private key which needs to be pasted into a file within tmp directory make sure to copy all of it
from the "begin rsa key" to the "end rsa key"
ssh -i filecontainingprivatekey.txt bandit17@localhost -p 2220

bandit17 -> bandit18
Find the difference between the two files: diff passwords.new passwords.old
passwordnew: hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg

bandit18 -> bandit19
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh"
The -t flag of the SSH command is used to specify the shell to be used to login into the system.
password:awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC

bandit19 -> bandit20
execute the setuid binary without any arguments to find out how to use it: ./bandit20-do
it is used by: ./bandit20-do command
passwords for files are usually found in /etc/bandit_pass/nameOfCurrentLevel
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
password: VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT

bandit20 -> bandit21
